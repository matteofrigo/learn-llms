# learn-llms
I use this repository to learn how to work with LLMs and their APIs.

Thanks Mistral AI for the free access to your APIs! :heart:

Covered topics:
* Hello world. [link](00-hello-world/README.md)
* Simple agent with memory and access to tools (RAG101). [link](01-agent-weather/README.md)

Topics I plan to cover:
* Testing and evaluation strategies.
* Guardrails, hallucination detection, reliability improvements.
* Human in the loop.
* Monitoring + cost/latency optimization.
* RAG done properly.
